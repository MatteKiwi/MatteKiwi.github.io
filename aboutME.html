          <h2>Why me</h2>
        </header>
        <hr/>
        <p>     
          Why would you want me to work for your company? 
          I am a highly motivated individual with a strong interest in software development, 
          and I believe that my skills and experiences make me an excellent fit for this role.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see from my attached resume, I have completed three years of study 
          in Technology at NTI Gymnasiet Stockholm, where I specialized in software development 
          and learned programming in C# and VR/AR development. This experience sparked 
          my interest in programming and solidified my desire to pursue a career in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my education, I also have experience working in the real estate 
          industry through my own company, Kivi Konsult. In this role, I was responsible 
          for maintaining several properties, including cleaning stairwells, taking care of 
          green areas, and replacing broken lights. This experience taught me the importance 
          of attention to detail and the ability to handle multiple tasks at once.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have also worked at ICA Nära Humlegården, where my tasks gradually became more 
         responsible and I gained experience with a wide range of responsibilities, 
         including opening and closing the store, ordering and handling goods, and 
         full understanding of the cash register system. This experience taught me the 
         importance of good customer service, the ability to handle stressful situations, 
         and the importance of taking on greater responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
        In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in C# and MySQL/ADO.NET/Entity Framework, 
        and I am currently learning JavaScript, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, and object-oriented design. 
        I am also fluent in Swedish and Spanish, and I have professional proficiency in English.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am confident that my skills, experiences, and passion for software development 
        make me an excellent fit for this position. I would be thrilled to have the 
        opportunity to contribute to your team and help drive your company's success. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Thank you for considering my application.
        Sincerely,
        Mathias Kiviniemi
